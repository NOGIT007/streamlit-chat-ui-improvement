## 🤩 Streamlit Chat Improvement

This side project aims to add new functionalities to the standard [Streamlit chat interface](https://docs.streamlit.io/develop/api-reference/chat):

-   📥 Chat history export (in JSON format)
-   🧹 Clear chat
-   🔁 Rerun last question
-   👍 and 👎 feedback buttons
-   💬 tokens count
-   👩‍💻 chat avatars personalization

The video below shows how they integrate into the UI:

The demo hosted [here](https://chat-ui-improvement.streamlit.app/) is limited to 3 questions and/or 300 tokens.

The code does not leverage all possible improvements offered by Streamlit (like caching) so I look forward to getting pull requests to make this small project better 😁
